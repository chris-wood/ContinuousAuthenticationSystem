Required:
---1. Port feature extraction code to python and test for correctness...
---2. Port Nate's code into the feature extraction template...
---3. Get the keylogger running and outputting the correct data in Linux...
---4. Have the feature extractor output CSV contents as Profile objects that are used to update the DATABASE (EDIT: it now stores everything as a list).
---5. Implement the adaptive user model scheme
---6. Figure out how user models will be stored (sqlite database? database traversed on every check?) (EDIT: CSV file to start, SQLite database later)
---7. Implement classifier that loads database and checks against all other users
---8. Implement the trainer class that stores initial user profiles in the database
---9. Test trainer class with feature extraction and user profile creation 
---10. Remove outliers for n < 5 and store average, pick median for n > 5 samples
---11. Remove similar features between users
---12. Test the system with friends (see if there is a difference in typing patterns about things in their brain or things transcribed)
---13. Implement classifier mode to write the aggregate log to a file with a sequence number, and then use this to collect logs to run through Weka

14. Collect all samples from all users and run classification (the problem is that my dataset is too small right now, I think)...

-----
Experiments: (TODO: select fixed set of classification algorithms to use)
---1. Run different "scenario" experiments on users, and compute difference between these user profiles
---2. Determine most effective classifier for each feature set (report data using Weka)
---3. Change features that are extracted and measure classification improvement
